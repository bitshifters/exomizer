Exomizer 1.1.5
--------------

What is it?

  The Exomizer is a cross-cruncher that runs on win32, dos or Linux as a
  command-line tool, but processes and generates files for the c64 and the
  c16/+4 computers.

   1) It is a cruncher that crunches c64/c16/+4 files.
   2) It can produce stand-alone self-decompressing c64/c16/+4-files.
   3) It can produce files for both "in memory" or "from disk" decrunching.
   4) It handles RLE-sequences well and fast, no packer is necessary.
   5) It's stand-alone decompressor can decompress $0400-$ffff (c64) or
      $0400-$fcff (c16/+4)
   6) It is able to crunch more than one infile into the same outfile (link).
   7) It is able to load infiles to any given address (simple relocate).


What is it not?

  It is not a generic file archiver. The purpose of the Exomizer is limited
  to the goal of:

  1) compressing .prg files to use less disk space.
  2) transparently recreate the larger memory image of the original .prg file
     when loading or running the compressed .prg file.

  For a good all purpose archiver check out the Commodore 8-bit native
  puzip/gunzip utilities at Pasi Ojala's Commodore & Compression Page

Why is it called Exomizer?

  More than ten years ago, I made some packers for the c64 that were named
  [name of group that I was a member of at the time]mizer.
  Since I'm not a member of any group now and it is a cross cruncher I
  figured 'Exo' was the perfect prefix. The 'mizer' suffix I just kept for
  nostalgic reasons.


What sets this program apart from similar programs like PuCrunch?

  This program has been designed with ONLY the compression rate in mind. Not
  many compromises has been made in the effort to achieve the highest
  compression rates possible. As a result of this Exomizer has some drawbacks:

   1) it may use up to 50MB of internal memory for worst case files.
   2) it may take several minutes to compress a file on a modern PC.


Are you releasing the source code?

  It is available in the distribution.


How do I invoke the exomizer?

  If you run the exomizer with the -? option it will print a description of
  the available options like this:

  prompt> exomizer -?
  usage: exomizer.exe [option]... infile[,<address>]...
   -r           writes the outfile backwards without load address, this is
                suitable for files that are to be decompressed directly
                from disk, can't be combined with -l or -s
   -l <address> adds load address to the outfile, using "auto" as <address>
                will enable load address auto detection, can't be combined
                with -r or -s, default is no load address
   -s <address> adds basic-line and decruncher that exits with a jmp <address>,
                using "sys" as <address> will enable basic-sys address auto
                detection, can't be combined with -r or -l
   -o <outname> sets the outfile name, default is "a.prg"
   -q           enable quiet mode, display output is reduced to one line
   -4           the decruncher targets the c16/+4 computers instead of the c64,
                must be combined with -s
   -n           turn off the decrunch effect shown by the decruncher, must be
                combined with -s
   -m <offset>  limits the maximum offset size
   -p <passes>  limits the maximum number of optimization passes
   --           treat all args to the right as non-options
   -?           displays this help screen
   -v           displays version and the usage license
  All infiles are merged into the outfile. They are loaded in the order
  they are given on the command-line, from left to right.
  prompt> _


Is it possible to specify an explicit load address for an infile ?

  Yes, just add a ,<address> to the infiles on the commandline, like this:

  prompt> exomizer -s0x1234 -o out.prg intro.prg program.prg,0x1000

  This will load the program.prg file beginning at $1000 while the intro.prg
  will load to it's normal address. Please note that there must not be any
  spaces between the filename, the ',' and the address.


What load addresses are valid for memory decrunching?

  This depends on the file you are decrunching. You don't want the decruncher
  to clobber the not yet decrunched data. However overlapping memory areas are
  still possible if enough safety margin is used. How much safety margin that
  is necessary depends on the file and on the crunching scheme. Let's take a
  nice easy file that loads from $4000 to $5000. Let's further say that you
  crunch this with the flag -l$4000. The crunched file will the load from $4000
  to $4635 or something like that. Since the Exomizer decrunches backwards an
  in-memory decrunch will go very well at the beginning since there is a large
  safety margin between where the decruncher reads ($4635 something) and writes
  ($5000 something). However the write address will then follow and gain on the
  read address. The trouble starts if it catches up with it. Then the
  decruncher will read already decrunched data instead of the expected crunched
  data and the decrunch will fail.

  So, what does this mean? It means that the crunched file has to be loaded to
  perhaps $3ff0 or so to avoid the read address being run over. The exact
  number of bytes to subtract from the original load address depends on the
  crunching scheme. The exomizer has a minimum safety margin of 3. But it can
  sometimes be larger depending on the crunched file.

  This all sounds very complicated, so why not just decide on a margin that is
  safe enough? Well, sometimes there may just not be any memory available to
  waste on decrunch safety margins and there may always be files for which the
  decided margin isn't big enough.

  But now Exomizer comes to the rescue. The -l flag now also takes the string
  literal "auto" as an argument. This argument tells the Exomizer to calculate
  the minimum safety necessary for the infile and use the original load
  address decreased by that amount. So back to the previous example: if the
  file is crunched with the flag "-l auto" it will load back to $3ffd or
  something like that. Decrunched from that address it will work.


Is it possible to use hexadecimal numbers for load and start addresses?

  Yes, use a '0x' or '$' prefix, like 0xc600 or $c600.
  (It is also possible to use octal notation, just use a prefix of '0'.)


Is it possible to crunch a basic program and then start it?

  Yes, but it requires a trampoline machine code routine to set up the basic
  environment. The exomizer decruncher has to be set to jmp to the start of
  the trampoline. It then set things up and starts the basic interpreter.

  You may do this manually as described below, or use the exobasic tool also
  included in this distribution. It can generate basic-trampolines but also do
  basic line renumbering and whitespace and rem statement removal etc.

  Assuming that the basic program is to be run at the standard location, $0801
  (c64) $1001 (c16/+4) the things that the trampoline needs to setup are:
  + The basic "start of basic variables" zero page pointer. ($2d/$2e) This
    pointer has to be set to somewhere safe, normally this is set to just
    beyond the basic program. In most cases it is enough to use the value
    normally set by the computer when loading the uncrunched basic program.
  + It is necessary to make sure that address $0800 (c64) or $1000 (c16/+4)
    contains a zero byte. This can be done by setting it in the trampoline
    or making sure that the address is covered by one of the files being
    crunched.
  + it has to start the basic interpreter. on a c64 this is done by
    a "jsr $A659", "jmp $A7AE" sequence and on the c16/+4 it is done by a
    "jsr $8BBE" followed by a "jmp $8BDC".

  In more complex situations, perhaps if the basic start is relocated or other
  data is stored in the basic variable area, it may be necessary set other
  basic zero page pointers like "start of basic text" ($2b/$2c) and/or "highest
  address used by basic" ($37/$38) as well.


Why are the colors wrong after decrunching on the c16/+4?

  The c16/+4 decruncher overwrites the Color/luminance table at $0113-$0123. A
  "jsr $F3B5" at the beginnig of the basic trampoline or in the beginning of
  the program will restore the table to the system default.


How much overhead does the builtin decruncher add to a file?

  These numbers compares resulting file sizes when crunching a file with the
  -s flag and crunching it with the -l flag. These numbers is for the c64
  decruncher. The c16/+4 decruncher adds another 3 bytes to the sizes and $0803
  to the addresses.

  Files with [load address < $0736] will get 288 bytes larger.
  Files with [$0736 <= load address < $0835] will get 273 bytes larger.
  Files with [$0835 <= load address] will get 267 bytes larger.


What memory addresses does the decruncher clobber?

  The following description covers the c64 decruncher. The c16/+4 decruncher
  differs from this description only by having a 3 bytes longer startup code,
  $07e7 changes to $0fe7, $081d changes to $1020 and $0835 changes to $1038.

  Except for the addresses covered by the file itself $0801-$XXXX, the
  decruncher also clobbers the following addresses:

  Eight zeropage addresses are used: $a7, $ae-$af, $fb-$ff.
  The decruncher clobbers the stack from $0100 to the stackpointer by copying
  186 bytes of itself (and possibly some more) to the stack at $0100-$01xx. The
  tape buffer is used for tables, 156 bytes in total at $0334-$03d0.

  The built-in decruncher will possibly transfer some of the crunched data
  before decrunching it. This copying assures that <start of crunched data> <=
  (<uncrunched data start> - <decrunch safety margin>). This is necessary in
  order for the data to decrunch properly.

  The decrunchers with decrunch effects will naturally clobber the addresses of
  the effect bytes too.

  The exodecrunch.s decruncher defaults to using the same zeropage addresses
  as the stand alone decruncher. It also uses a 156 byte table. However both
  the table area and the zeropage addresses are easy to relocate.


How do I use the decruncher sourcecode?

  You simply call jsr decrunch_file. But first you must have implemented a
  suitable get_byte routine for it. The decruncher has only a simple
  get_byte provided as an example. If you want to decrunch from file you have
  to write the file handling routines yourselves. See the exodecrunch.s file
  for more info.


Does it have any weak points?

  Yes, it is not very good at crunching already crunched data. It has not been
  a priority for me to fix this because I feel that crunching already crunched
  data is something that should be avoided. No cruncher is good at it and it
  will, at best, just create longer decrunch times.
  Exomizer just happens to be worse at this than some other crunchers.
  In fact, my experience is that the Exomizer likes totally unpacked and
  uncrunched files best.


Some Performance numbers:

  These tests are made on a AMD duron 700MHz. the ByteBoiler+RLE sizes for
  the delenn.bin sheridan.bin and ivanova.bin has been taken from the home-
  page of PuCrunch. I could not get them so small myself and I really want
  to show the best possible figures for any cruncher. The Exomizer sizes
  includes the c64 decruncher (-s option).

What else c64-related have you made?

  I have previously made some native packers for the c64 and an iffl-
  system, but that was at least ten years ago or so.
