----------
1.1.5 released. dos (djgpp), win32 (mingw) and linux (gcc) binaries.
+ rename files to only have one . in their names.
+ new sequence matching algorithm that also handles long rle-sequences
  without slowing down like the old one did.
+ bugfix: use -lauto mechanism for built in decrunchers too in order to handle
  files that requires large safety margins. Previously, files that contained
  previously crunched data could fail for this reason. Thanks to Csabo / LOD
  for reporting this one.
+ bugfix: Now -ssys works when using the c64-noeffect and 16/+4-effect
  decruncher too.
+ bugfix: Now the c16/plus4 version of the trampoline generated by exobasic
  works as expected. Thanks to Csabo / LOD for reporting this bug.
+ improvment: Now the exobasic tool can regenerate the system color table
  in its c16/plus4 trampoline.
+ contrib/exo-4k.asm by Ninja/The Dreams updated to v1.2
+ updates to the exomizer115.txt file.
+ updates to the exobasic10b2.txt file.

2004-06-02
----------
1.1.4p1 released. dos (djgpp), win32 (mingw) and linux (gcc) binaries.
+ bugfix The only change compared to 1.1.4 is a bugfixed exodecrunch.s.
  (now one byte longer) The binaries are the same as 1.1.4.

2004-05-29
----------
1.1.4 released. dos (djgpp), win32 (mingw) and linux (gcc) binaries.
+ added a section in the documentation about a fix for c16/+4 color corruption
  after decrunch.
+ changed the noeffect decruncher for c16/+4 to allow decruncing of data
  occupying $0400-b$fcff.
+ added a contrib directory for distribution of contributed related material.
  First out is Ninja/The Dreams with the source code to a very size-optimized
  c64 decruncher for 4k-demos or similar usage where every byte counts. Please
  see the "exo-4k.asm" file for information about how to use it.
+ normal decruncher source (exodecrunch.s) is now shorter and faster. Thanks to
  Ninja/The Dreams for suggesting some of the changes.
+ the flag -l now also accepts the string auto as an argument. Giving this
  string results in that the cruncher will use the address of the infile with
  the lowest address decreased by the calculated minimum safety margin. Thanks
  to Ninja/The Dreams for suggesting this feature.
+ normal decruncher source (exodecrunch.s) reworked and just like the stream
  decrunchers there's an example application for it included. All decruncher
  sourcecode + examples are located in the 'decruncher' directory and have been
  updated to work with the cc65 2.10 toolchain and gnu make.
+ fix some additional spelling errors.

2003-08-21
----------
1.1.3 released. dos (djgpp), win32 (mingw) and linux (gcc) binaries.
+ new flag, -p<n>, that limits the number of optimization passes. This flag
  combined with the -m flag like this: -p1 -m1024, will make the exomizer a lot
  faster at the expense of the crunch ratio. Something for your test builds
  perhaps? Thanks to Lasse Öörni for suggesting this feature.
+ the flag -s now also accepts the string sys as an argument. Giving this
  string results in that the cruncher will look in the infiles for a basic
  sysline and use the address the sys command targets. Thanks to Ninja/The
  Dreams for suggesting this feature.
- No work has been made on the exobasic tool. I assume it works since I have
  received no feedback for it at all since the 1.1.2 release. :)
- I have new email address, magli143@comhem.se.

2003-06-14
----------
1.1.2 released. dos (djgpp), win32 (mingw) and linux (gcc) binaries.
+ this release now includes the exobasic tool (v1.0b1). This tool makes it
  easier to crunch basic programs. It takes care of setting all those zero page
  values and also includes a whitespace/remark remover and a line renumberer.
  Please see the exobasic-1.0b1.txt file for more info.
+ new flag, -n, that removes the decrunch effect of the -s decruncher.
- due to the new handling of files with really long rle-sequences, some files
  may actually crunch a few bytes worse than with the 1.1.1 version.
+ two kinds of stream decrunchers included, one 'get next byte' kind
  (exostreamdecr1.s) and one faster 'get next chunk' kind (exostreamdecr2.s).
  the chunk version has several limitations:
    1) the chunk size has to be 2^x where 0 <= x <= 7
    2) the size of the decrunched data has to be a multiple of the chunk size.
  Both versions has the following limitations:
    1) the circular buffer must be page-aligned and it's size must be a
       multiple of 256.
  Since this is beginnig to get non-trivial there's an example application
  included. To compile it out of the box, you need a gnu compatible make
  program and the exellent cc65 toolchain available from www.cc65.org.

2003-04-27
----------
1.1.2beta2
+ documentation fixes, Thanks to Ninja/The Dreams for pointing them out to me.
+ faster 'pull' decruncher.
+ by popular demand, new -n option that removes the decrunch effect of the
  built-in decruncher. The generated decruncher is a few bytes smaller than the
  normal one for both c64 and c16/plus4.

2003-03-29
----------
1.1.2beta1 released to testers win32 only, no source
+ portability: It now builds and runs on cygwin, mingw32 and djgpp targets too.
  Thanks to Rafal Szyja for helping me to test this.
+ bugfix: better handling of files with really long rle sequences. Bug reported
  by 6R6/Nostalgia.
+ new 'pull' oriented decruncher that uses a circular buffer. This is more
  useful in situations where sequential access to the decrunched data is
  wanted. Much like streaming it from a file, you read it byte by byte from
  the decruncher. Please note that this is still experimental. The support
  for this kind of usage is not really good in the cruncher and the decruncher
  decrunches backwards in memory which is counter-intuitive when streaming
  data. It is also somewhat slower than the normal decruncher.

2003-01-25
----------
1.1.1 released win32 and linux binaries compressed with upx and source code.
+ some further cleaning up of the exomizer-1.1.1.txt file.
+ rename exomizer-1.1.txt to exomizer-1.1.1.txt
+ decreased safety buffer size of the built-in decruncher. This removed
  'garbage' seen on screen while decrunching files that load >= $0800 ($1000).
  This leaves only the decrunch effect visible in the lower right corner.
+ changed basic line number to 2003
+ updated copyright dates in files modified since v1.1.
+ shorted built-in decruncher by one byte.
+ bugfix for the decruncher source file 'exodecrunch.s'. Bug reported by
  Soci / Singular. The latest version without this bug was 1.0beta3.
+ added a credits section to the exomizer-1.1.1.txt

2002-12-30
----------
1.1.1beta1 released to testers win32 only, no source.
+ bug: fixed bug in c16/+4 decruncher where the decrunch effect sometimes
  was invisible.
+ '$' is now allowed as well as 0x as a prefix for hexadecimal constants.
+ added a feature to relocate the files to be crunched. just add a ",addr" to
  the filename. obs. no spaces. addr may be decimal octal or hexadecimal and is
  parsed like all other command line constants.
+ update the exomizer-1.1.txt file to include hints about relocation and how to
  start basic programs from the built in Exomizer decruncher.

2002-10-06
----------
1.1 released win32 and linux, including source code.
+ decruncher 4 bytes shorter, both built-in and sourcecode versions.
+ updated the performance comparison section.
+ fixed even more spelling errors :)

2002-09-26
----------
1.1beta1 released win32 only, no source.
+ Can now create self extracting files for the c16/+4 family of computers too.
+ minor tweaks to textfiles and some spelling corrected.
- no difference whatsoever in crunching result compared to the 1.0 version

2002-05-01
----------
1.0 released, win32 and linux binaries (compressed with upx) + sourcecode.
+ Really fixed the bug I said I fixed in the last beta. If the beta3 Exomizer
  was run without any of the -l, -r or -s flags to produce a memory decrunch-
  able file without a start address, the output file was generated as if the -r
  flag was specified. Not anymore.
+ Corrected/adjusted comments in the exodecrunch.s file.
+ 1 byte shorter decruncher, both builtin and source code versions.
+ Wrote a special routine to copy crunched data if copy length <= 256. This
  makes the -s decruncher for files with [$074E <= load address < $084E] 15
  bytes shorter than in beta3.
+ Made -s decruncher for files with [$084E <= load address] 3 bytes longer than
  in beta3. This was done in order to make the previously invisible decrunch
  effect visible. Not such a big loss considering that it now is 6 bytes
  shorter than the decruncher for files with [$074E <= load address < $084E]
  and 21 bytes shorter than the one for files with [load address < $074E].
+ updated exomizer-1.0.txt with info about builtin decruncher sizes.

2002-04-13
----------
beta3 released, win32 (exomizer.exe) and Linux (exomizer.lnx) binaries.
win32 exe built using visual studio 6.0. The linux binary was built on
A redhat 7.3 system. It uses no fancy system stuff so it should be runnable
on any glibc2 based linux system. However, this has not been tested.

+ sourcecode and a Linux Makefile in the exomizer-src-1.0beta3.zip file.
  To build on Linux just type make.
  To build in visual studio, just create a console app project and add
  all the *.c and *.h files. The Exomizer uses a lot of stackspace so
  in order to run properly on win32 the stack size has to be increased.
  The visual studio linker option /stack:0x800000 sets the stacksize to be
  8 Megabyte. (The same size that Linux defaults to)
+ new feature, a -q option for quiet mode. The Exomizer only outputs one line
  on stdout if it is invoked with this flag.
+ A bug has been fixed, if Exomizer was run without any of the -l, -r or -s
  flags to produce a memory decrunchable file without a start address, parts of
  the decruncher was added to the output file.
+ changed the decruncher to use less harmful zeropage addresses.
+ changed the decruncher source: moved the small static tables into the de-
  cruncher and out of the relocatable tables area. This allows the application
  to safely reuse/overwrite that memory area between decrunches.
+ updated exomizer-1.0.txt with info about addresses clobbered by the
  decruncher and howto enter hexadecimal option arguments.
+ the license printed by -u has been updated to reflect the same license as
  the source code is released under.

2002-03-17
----------
win32 only beta2 released.
There is no changes in compression rates since beta1.
The binary itself is now compressed with upx-1.20.

This beta release includes some changes to the licensing. Now, the software may
only be used for non-commercial purposes. However, the files it generates and
the decruncher sourcecode may be used for commercial purposes. This may sound
conflicting but I want to avoid the situation where the binary itself or it's
sourcecode is used and/or distributed as a part of a commercial application.

2002-03-11
----------
internal release.
To use the decrunch routine in your own projects you have to implement your
own get_byte routine. This routine reads the next byte from the compressed
data stream. This stream may be stored on disc or in memory - It's up to you.
The decruncher doesn't care. All it needs to know is what routine to jsr to
get the next byte.

All implementations of the get_byte routine have to preserve the values of the
x and y registers and the carry flag state. The decruncher depends on those
being unchanged.

When the decruncher is done it will rts nicely to the caller. This means that
you can make a stream consisting of more than one compressed data file and jsr
the decruncher the corresponding number of times, without the need to
reinitialize the stream in between.


2002-03-08
----------
internal release.
This beta release features an updated exodecrunch.s. This version is tested and
works.

This release also introduces copyright notices and a usage license,
updated texts in the binary and an updated exomizer_beta.txt file.


2002-03-06
----------
beta1 released.
The program should be quite self explanatory, just run it with the -? option.
The exodecrunch.s is a asm sourcefile that assembles with the ca65 assembler
included in the cc65 compiler package. The decruncher sourcefile is based on
the one used in the sfx-routines but with an easily exchangeable get_byte
routine. It may contain silly bugs, but they should be easy to spot.
